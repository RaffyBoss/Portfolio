# Raphael Castellano Portfolio - Design Framework

## Design Philosophy

**Visual Language**: Modern editorial aesthetic inspired by high-end design publications like Kinfolk and Wired. Clean, sophisticated typography with strategic use of whitespace and bold visual elements.

**Color Palette**: 
- Primary: Deep charcoal (#1a1a1a) and warm white (#fafafa)
- Accent: Muted teal (#4a9b8e) for highlights and interactive elements
- Supporting: Soft gray (#6b7280) for secondary text
- Warning: Warm amber (#f59e0b) for call-to-action elements

**Typography**:
- Display: "Playfair Display" - elegant serif for headings and hero text
- Body: "Inter" - clean sans-serif for readability and modern feel
- Code: "JetBrains Mono" - for technical content and project descriptions

## Visual Effects & Interactions

**Core Libraries Used**:
1. **Anime.js** - Smooth micro-interactions and element animations
2. **Splitting.js** - Advanced text effects with character-level animations
3. **ECharts.js** - Interactive skill visualization and project metrics
4. **Splide.js** - Elegant project carousels and image galleries
5. **p5.js** - Creative coding background effects and visual experiments
6. **Matter.js** - Physics-based interactions for portfolio pieces
7. **Typed.js** - Dynamic typewriter effects for hero section
8. **Pixi.js** - High-performance visual effects and shaders

**Header Effects**:
- Subtle particle system background using p5.js
- Gradient text animation with color cycling
- Smooth scroll-triggered parallax elements

**Interactive Elements**:
- 3D tilt effects on project cards
- Magnetic cursor interactions
- Smooth morphing buttons with hover states
- Dynamic skill bars with animated fills
- Project gallery with smooth transitions

**Scroll Motion**:
- Gentle fade-in animations (opacity 0.9 to 1.0)
- Minimal vertical translation (16-24px)
- Staggered reveals for content sections
- Smooth easing curves throughout

**Hover Effects**:
- Project cards: 3D perspective shift with shadow expansion
- Images: Subtle zoom (1.0 to 1.05) with overlay reveals
- Buttons: Color morphing with glow edges
- Links: Animated underlines with gradient fills
